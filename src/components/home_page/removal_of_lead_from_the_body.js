      <h2>Removal of Lead from the Body</h2>
      <div className="card">
        <p>
          Depending on the different body parts that are exposed to lead, it
          requires different intervals of time for removal. These intervals of
          time are based on the half-life of lead. Once the lead enters the body
          around 95% of the lead is stored in the teeth and bones of humans
          (body burden). It can take up to 10 years for the lead to be extracted
          from the body. This allotted period of time is a stark contrast to the
          25 day period for half the lead to be removed from the blood, and 40
          day period for half the lead to be removed from the soft tissues
          naturally. While there are main methods for one to remove lead
          naturally from the body, there are a few strategies to combat and
          limit the intake of lead exposure.

            <h3>Eating food fortified with vitamin C, iron, and calcium</h3>
            <p>
              Vitamin C helps with absorbing more iron. Iron is significant in
              combating lead poisoning because iron protects oneâ€™s body from
              lead exposure by binding to lead, thus preventing absorption.
            </p>
            <p>
              Increasing the intake of calcium rich foods such as green
              vegetables and dairy helps because it makes it harder for lead to
              accumulate in the bones.

      <h3>Chelation Therapy</h3>
      <div className="card">
        <p>
          Chelation therapy consists of two distinct methods: Chelation therapy
          and EDTA chelation therapy.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h3>Chelation Therapy</h3>
          </li>
          <p>
            Chelation therapy is practiced when either the children or adult
            experiences an increased lead level in the blood of 45 mcg/dL or
            greater. This treatment consists of a 400 mg of calcium disodium
            EDTA medication that is directly consumed by mouth so that it binds
            with the lead and excreted as urine.
          </p>
          <li>
            <h3>EDTA Chelation Therapy</h3>
          </li>
          <p>
            EDTA chelation therapy is practiced under the circumstance where
            children/adults cannot tolerate the drug used in the conventional
            standard. EDTA chelation therapy similarly uses calcium disodium
            ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid but is instead injected through
            weekly 30 minutes intervals of IV treatment. The EDTA binds to the
            lead in the bloodstream, and in response constructs a compound that
            can be easily removed by the body through urine.
