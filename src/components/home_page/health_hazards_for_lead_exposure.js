      <h2>Health Hazards For Lead Exposure</h2>
      <div className="card">
        <h3>Children</h3>
        <p>
          There is no safe blood level for children. As a result, protecting
          them from lead exposure is important for their future health. Even
          exposure to low lead levels is seen to negatively impact children,
          such as, affecting their cognitive development. If caught early the
          effects of lead can be reversible, but continued exposure to lead can
          cause permanent damage. Children can get exposed to lead by touching,
          swallowing, or breathing in lead or lead dust. These damaging effects
          can cause damage to the brain and nervous system, slowed growth
          development, learning behavior problems, and hearing speech problems.
          When a child is exposed to lead, it’s often difficult to see. There is
          no immediate symptom in recognizing lead exposure. Lead exposure is
          more harmful to children less than six years old because their bodies
          are still growing. A children’s blood lead level can increase greatly
          once they swallow lead. However, when the exposure stops, the blood
          lead level decreases gradually. Children alsos release lead through
          urine, sweat, and feces. However, it can take decades for the amount
          of lead to decrease in bones.

        <h3>Adults</h3>
        <p>
          Exposure to lead is not only dangerous to children but also for
          adults. When adults are exposed to lead, they may have high blood
          pressure, joint and muscle pain, difficulties with memory or
          concentration, headache, abdominal pain, mood disorders, reduced sperm
          count and abnormal sperm, and miscarrieg, stillbirth or premature
          birth in pregnant women.

      <h3>Are the Effects of Lead Reversible?</h3>
      <div className="card">
        <b>No,</b> the effects of lead exposure aren’t reversible. However, by
        finding and removing the source of lead blood lead levels can decrease.
        Even though lead poisoning is irreversible, lead poisoning is
        preventable. Eating high amounts of iron, calcium, and vitamin C can
        help protect against lead. Washing commonly used objects such as toys
        can reduce the risk of lead exposure.
