      <h2>Health Hazards For Lead Exposure</h2>
      <p>
        When lead is stored into our body, it is absorbed into bones, blood, and
        tissues. As a person ages, their bones will remineralize and internal
        exposure can increase the result of larger releases of lead from the
        bone tissue. Lead poisoning can occur if a person is exposed to very
        high levels of lead over a short period of time. The person may feel
        abdominal pain. Constipated, tired, headachy, irritable, memory loss.
        These symptoms can appear solely leading to lead poisoning being
        overlooked. Exposure to high level of lead may cause anemia, weakness,
        and kidney and brain damage. Very high lead exposure can cause death. In
        addition, lead can also pose a threat to pregnant women. Lead can cross
        the placental barrier, which means pregnant women who are exposed to
        lead also expose their unborn child. Lead cna damage a developing baba’s
        nervous system. Even low-level lead exposures in developing babies have
        been found to affect behavior and intelligence. Lead exposure can cause
        miscarriage, stillbirths, and infertility. Generally, lead affects
        children more than adults. Children ten to show signs of severe toxicity
        to lead at lower levels. Lead poisoning can occur in children where
        their parents accidentally brought home lead dust on their loathing. A
        person who is exposed to lead over a period of time may feel abdominal
        pain, constipated, depressed, distracted, forgetful, irritable,
        nauseous/sick. People with prolonged exposure to lead may also be at
        risk for high blood pressure, heart disease, kidney disease, and reduced
        fertility. Furthermore, the Department of Health and Human Services
        (DHHS), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the International
        Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) have determined that lead is
        cancer-causing in humans. Protecting children from lead exposure is to
        important for their overall health. No safe blood lead level in children
        has been identified. Even low exposure of lead in children is seen to
        have a negative impact on a child's intelligence, ability to pay
        attention, and academic achievement. Once a child swallows lead, their
        blood lead level rises. Once a child’s exposure to lead stops, the
        amount of lead in the blood gradually decreases. The child’s body
        releases the lead through urine, sweat, and feces. Lead is also stored
        in bone, and can take decades for lead stored in bones to decrease.
