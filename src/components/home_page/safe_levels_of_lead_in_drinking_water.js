        According to the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Environmental Protection
        Agency (EPA) states that <b>15 ppb (0.015 mg/L)</b> is an accountable
        level in drinking water. Moreover, the EPA implements the amount of lead
        in drinking water to be zero because exposure to even a small amount of
        lead is harmful. Utilities that are using someoneâ€™s tap should not
        exceed 0.15 ppb in 90% of the appliances.
